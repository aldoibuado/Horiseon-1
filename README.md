# Horiseon-1

## Description

My motivation for working on this website was to test the knowledge I have gained to refactor the code to make it more access friendly to those who may have a disability and rely on assistive technologies. It helps to have an accessible website that everyone is able to access and having options for screen readers to describe an image. A company can have more customers come to their page if it is accessible to everyone. Learning the importance of putting semantic elements in proper places in the index.html will help the structure of the code and make it more readable. Also removing redundant css selectors to help application be more organized.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon going to the website, you are able to click on search engine optimization, online reputation management, social media marketing, which will then take you to the respective sections. I have included a screenshot of both the three areas you are able to click and the sections it will take you to for more information.

Here is the link to the deployed website!
